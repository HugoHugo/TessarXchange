## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/TessarXchange/tessarxchange.git
cd tessarxchange
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set up environment variables:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

alembic upgrade head
```

### Running the Application

Development mode:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

```

## API Documentation

The TessarXchange API documentation is available at `/docs` when running the application. It provides detailed information about all endpoints, request/response formats, and authentication requirements.

### Authentication

The API uses JWT tokens for authentication. To obtain a token:

1. Register a new user: `POST /api/v1/users/register`
2. Login to get JWT token: `POST /api/v1/users/login`
3. Use the token in the Authorization header: `Bearer <token>`
